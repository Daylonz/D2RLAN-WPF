1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:04,125
[eerie music]

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,917
[Marius] We traveled east,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,167
over the mountains
and into the vast deserts of broken lands.

4
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:28,750
As the days passed,
my companion told me of himself -

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,500
that he had once been a great warrior...

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,292
and that a dark and secret burden
now weighed heavily upon him.

7
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:46,333
We traveled for an eternity
across that arid wasteland.

8
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:50,417
How long? [chuckles] I couldn't say.

9
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:56,333
And always,
a dark cloud seemed to follow us,

10
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,542
just over the horizon.

11
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,333
Finally, the journey ended;

12
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,167
we climbed the last ridge.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,458
There, below us, lay our destination.

14
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:15,667
The shining jewel, Lut Gholein,

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,833
with the great sea beyond.

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,750
We made camp that last night.

17
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:29,542
Perhaps it was the warm desert wind
or the sound of the ocean,

18
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:33,000
but for the first time in many weeks,

19
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,875
I slept.

20
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:38,000
However, the dreams returned,

21
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,583
but these were clearly not my own.

22
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,250
I beheld a vision of a great man,

23
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,708
the Mage, Tal Rasha.

24
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:47,792
You were there, too, Tyrael.

25
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:51,375
I remember seeing you in my dream.

26
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,667
His brethren had cornered a great demon,

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,458
Baal, Lord of Destruction,

28
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:00,458
who had been set loose upon the world.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,750
They attempted to imprison the demon
within a sacred stone.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,042
Yet, when their attempts failed,

31
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:18,792
Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered
to contain the demon within himself,

32
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,667
completing the prison.

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,583
He instructed his brethren
to bind him within a tomb,

34
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,875
buried under the sand,

35
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:33,042
there to wrestle with the demon
for all eternity.

36
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,125
[screams]

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,542
[gasps]

38
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
[wolf yapping in distance]

39
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,750
Now you know what I seek, Marius.

40
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,833
This is my brother.

41
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:52,750
Sleep now. We set out with the dawn.

42
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,833
[wolf howls]

43
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,625
[Marius] The next morning,
we walked over the hill,

44
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,375
toward Lut Gholein.

45
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,667
I had no idea then of the horrors

46
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,792
that were in store for me there.
