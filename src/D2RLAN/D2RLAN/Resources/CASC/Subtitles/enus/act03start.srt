1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,167
[eerie music]

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:19,583
[Marius] My companion drew in the dank,
cold air of the tomb.

3
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,583
It seemed to...

4
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,333
strengthen him.

5
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:27,500
[wind whistling]

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,042
I stood in the doorway,
between light and dark.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:37,542
What was left of my sanity
implored me not to enter.

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:43,458
But that voice was just a whisper now.

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,083
As we worked our way down,
deeper and deeper into the crypt,

10
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:54,333
I began to see a change in my companion.

11
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:57,833
He seemed to be gaining strength.

12
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:04,833
I could hardly see in the gloom,
but my companion seemed to know the way.

13
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:11,375
We came, at last, to a great hall.

14
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,458
[bats chittering]

15
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,708
[wailing echoes in distance]

16
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:26,875
[Wanderer grunts]

17
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,833
[screaming]

18
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,333
[screaming stops]

19
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,167
[wailing echoes in distance]

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,250
[Marius] It was then I realized
my companion hadn't been gaining strength.

21
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:53,375
He had been losing
what was left of his humanity.

22
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,458
[ominous orchestral music]

23
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,875
[Tal Rasha wailing]

24
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,917
[bats chittering]

25
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,625
[Marius] He moved with demonic speed,

26
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,375
and then... and then you appeared.

27
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,708
[Tyrael] Stop!

28
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,250
The beast contained herein
shall not be set free.

29
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,875
Not even by you.

30
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,292
[Wanderer yells]

31
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,958
[yelling fades out]

32
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,333
[bridge creaking]

33
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,417
[wailing]

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,958
[wailing]

35
00:02:55,625 --> 00:03:00,708
Look what they've done to me.
Release me. Help me.

36
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
[bridge creaking]

37
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,875
Hurry. Please hurry!

38
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,958
[sword clanging]

39
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,417
[Tyrael] No! Don't do it!

40
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,708
[wailing stops]

41
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,542
[Tyrael] Fool! You have just ensured
the doom of this world.

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,375
You cannot even begin to imagine
what you've set in motion this day.

43
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,375
Go to the Temple of Light,
in the Eastern city of Kurast.

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,083
There you will find the gate to Hell
open before you.

45
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:51,250
You must find the courage
to step through that gate, Marius.

46
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,792
Take the stone you hold to the Hellforge,
where it will be destroyed.

47
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,208
Now, run. Take the stone and run!

48
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,042
[Marius] What choice did I have?

49
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,542
I ran.
