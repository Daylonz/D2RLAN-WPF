1
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:04,208
[eerie music]

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,667
[gate slams]

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,417
[voices calling out]

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,083
I heard later that he was defeated...

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:32,583
...and that the Soulstones
were destroyed in Hellforge.

6
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,375
All except one.

7
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,208
[sobbing]

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,958
Oh, I failed, Tyrael.

9
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,333
I couldn't do as you asked.

10
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,167
I couldn't enter that Gate.

11
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:05,042
Forgive me, Tyrael.

12
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,833
Forgive me.

13
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:09,000
[sobbing]

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Marius, give me the stone
and all is forgiven.

15
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,750
Give it to me, Marius.

16
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,458
Take it. Take it, take it!

17
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:37,750
I'm glad this is finally over, Tyrael.

18
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:42,417
Look what the stone has done to me!

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,542
[sobbing]

20
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,625
[voices yelling in distance]

21
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,500
You haven't failed, old man.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,333
You've done exactly
as you were meant to do.

23
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,083
However...

24
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,500
I am not the Archangel Tyrael.

25
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,833
[inhales]

26
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,042
Baal.

27
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,000
Lo!

28
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:17,667
Lo, lo, lo, lo! Lo!

29
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,917
[Baal chuckles]

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,333
You have done well, Marius.

31
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,042
Now I think you shall have your reward.

32
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,542
What have I done to deserve this?

33
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,417
[yelling voice fades out]

34
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,583
[dramatic orchestral music]

35
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,667
[screaming in distance]
