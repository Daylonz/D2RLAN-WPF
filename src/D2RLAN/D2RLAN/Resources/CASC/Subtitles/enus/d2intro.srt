1
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:04,833
[voices calling out] Marius!

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:06,792
Marius!

3
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,833
-Marius!
-Marius!

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,333
[ominous piano music]

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,167
[calling out continues]

6
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,250
[footsteps]

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,125
[lock turns]

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,708
[gate creaks]

9
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,250
[Marius muttering]

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,083
[lock turns]

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,000
[door creaks]

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,250
[Marius muttering]

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,625
[fly buzzing]

14
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,083
[whip cracks, man screams]

15
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,375
[Marius grunts]

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,458
[cheering and laughter in distance]

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,583
[Marius whimpers]

18
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,167
[plate clatters]

19
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,500
[whip cracks, man screams]

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,958
[stranger] So, Marius, at last I find you.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
[enchanting music]

22
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,958
Tyrael. Yes.

23
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:25,708
Yes, now I... now I recognize you, you...

24
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,000
I should have known
you'd travel in disguise.

25
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,583
[breathing heavily]

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:36,417
They're... They're always watching.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,042
[stranger] I've been searching for you
for a long time, Marius.

28
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:45,000
I was rather beginning to think
you didn't want to be found.

29
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:50,167
Oh, forgive me, Tyrael, please.

30
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:54,208
It... It wasn't my fault.

31
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,500
[stranger] Not your fault?

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,750
Tell me, Marius,
how was it not your fault?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,750
The Wanderer...

34
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,667
Yes, it was...

35
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,583
was the Wanderer.

36
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,458
[flames crackling]

37
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:20,708
[Marius] My days in the Rogue Citadel
seem so long ago.

38
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:27,958
I sought refuge from my memories
in the company of other outcasts,

39
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:31,792
high in the mountains,
past the Eastern Gate.

40
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,083
Do you want something?

41
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,167
[Marius groans weakly]

42
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,542
[waiter groans]

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,500
[Marius] Oh, I fought sleep
for days at a time.

44
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,875
For when I dreamt,
the memories would return.

45
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,417
[Marius wailing]

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,917
Memories of the Monastery,

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,167
and the evil which had claimed it.

48
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,208
Dreams, memories...

49
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,292
I couldn't tell the difference anymore.

50
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,000
[door opens, wind howling]

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,375
Had the evil from my dreams
followed me at my heels?

52
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,417
How had he found me here?

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,583
[sword scraping]

54
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,958
How could this broken shell of a man,

55
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:42,208
barely able to carry
the weight of his own sword...

56
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,042
be the burning terror

57
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,042
which drove me to hide here?

58
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,125
[floorboards creaking]

59
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,250
[man] Hmm.

60
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,750
[man grunts]

61
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,958
[sword thuds]

62
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,042
[sword rocking]

63
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,917
[Marius] He seemed to...

64
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,958
to have demons of his own

65
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,917
that he struggled to contain.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,167
[laughs]

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
[demonic growl]

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,833
[Marius] And he was losing.

69
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,333
[laughter distorts]

70
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,417
[clattering]

71
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,542
[laughter stops]

72
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,083
[demonic jabbering]

73
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,583
[demon snarling]

74
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,583
[Marius groans]

75
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,625
[demons cackling]

76
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:53,000
[Marius] As I watched, I...
I became convinced

77
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:57,000
that I was truly mad.

78
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,875
The terror, the destruction, the...

79
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,333
the evil I witnessed -

80
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,042
how else could I explain them?

81
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,750
Were these the demons from my dream,

82
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,667
or were they born...

83
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,292
within the Wanderer?

84
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,833
[demonic wailing]

85
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,333
[man gasps]

86
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,542
[swords clattering]

87
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,542
[waiter screams]

88
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:39,375
[man groans]

89
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,667
[Wanderer groaning]

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,375
[demonic wailing]

91
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,417
[bats chittering]

92
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,875
[pipe clatters]

93
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,083
[wind howling]

94
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,958
[Marius] Why did I follow him?

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,125
I don't know.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,292
Why do things happen as they do in dreams?

97
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,125
All I know is that when he beckoned...

98
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,333
I had to follow him.

99
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,750
From that moment, we traveled together.

100
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,833
East.

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,042
Always into the East.

102
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,125
[flames whooshing]

103
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,833
[flames crackling]
