1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,167
[eerie music]

2
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,750
[Marius] I did as you told me, Tyrael.

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:23,625
I found the Temple of the Zakarum.

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,125
In the deepest recesses of the Temple,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,458
I found a dark gathering:

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,667
my companion, the Wanderer...

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,125
Tal Rasha...

8
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,458
and a Great Evil...

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:43,292
who could only be
the Lord of Hatred himself.

10
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,458
Mephisto!

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,958
I heard a voice then...

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:53,833
like a thousand needles in my heart.

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:59,250
[Mephisto] My brothers,
at long last we stand reunited.

14
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,625
The Infernal Gate has been prepared,

15
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,000
and the time of our final victory
is at hand.

16
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:09,750
Let the way to Hell be opened!

17
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,500
And the evil that was once vanquished
shall rise anew.

18
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,292
[wailing from Infernal Gate]

19
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:23,292
Wrapped in the guise of man
shall he walk amongst the innocent,

20
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:28,000
and terror shall consume
they that dwell upon the Earth.

21
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,125
The skies shall rain fire,

22
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,375
and the seas will become as blood.

23
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,625
The righteous shall fall
before the wicked,

24
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:52,167
and all creation shall tremble
before the burning standards of Hell!

25
00:01:54,708 --> 00:02:00,583
[Marius] What I saw then
was not meant for mortal eyes.

26
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,583
[Mephisto] The Gate stands ready.

27
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,667
[Wanderer screaming]

28
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,792
[Mephisto] Now, my young brother,

29
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,333
the time has come
to assume your true form.

30
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,917
[demonic snarling]

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,417
[wailing from Infernal Gate]

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,042
[Mephisto] Arise, Diablo...

33
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,167
Lord of Terror!

34
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,833
[rumbling footsteps]

35
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,125
[bones cracking]

36
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:02,250
[Mephisto] You are the harbinger
of our return, Diablo.

37
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,417
Send forth your terror into Hell!

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
[wailing from Infernal Gate]

39
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,875
[dramatic orchestral music]

40
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,542
[wailing continues]
