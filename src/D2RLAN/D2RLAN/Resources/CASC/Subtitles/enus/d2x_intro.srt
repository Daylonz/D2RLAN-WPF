1
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:06,000
[eerie music]

2
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,458
[wind howling]

3
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,208
[horn bellows]

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,708
[sighs] Baal.

5
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:43,792
[doors creaking]

6
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,708
[doors slam]

7
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,958
[sighs]

8
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:03,833
Baal!

9
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,042
The gates of Sescheron have stood for eons
beyond remembrance.

10
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,875
And you shall not breach them now.

11
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,667
Remove your foul demons from our lands!

12
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,250
We stand on the side of Light!

13
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,250
You shall not be allowed
to reach Mount Arreat.

14
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,958
And that which you seek will not be yours.

15
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:30,750
Enough! [echoing continues]

16
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,708
[echoing fades out]

17
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:52,208
I shall take your position
into consideration.

18
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,167
[ominous music]

19
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,625
[rumbling]

20
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,208
[rumbling]

21
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,958
[chuckles]

22
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:38,750
Well, it seems your terms
are not acceptable.

23
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,667
[cackles]

24
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,083
[demons yelling]

25
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,250
[distorted scream]
